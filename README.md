# Problem Statement

This notepad GUI will consist of various menus like
file and edit, using which all functionalities like saving the file, opening a
file, editing, cut and paste can be done.For creating this GUI we are going
to first install the tkinter module using the command: ‘ pip install tk ’.
After importing the tkinter module we are going to use it for
messageDialog,FileDialog,etc.The main purpose of the OS module that we
are going to import is to interact with our operating system. The primary
use we find for it is to create folders, remove folders, move folders, and
sometimes change the working directory. We can also access the names of
files within a file path by doing listdir().We are going to use file operations
like :open(),close(),read(),write(),etc.to edit the files in our notepad.
